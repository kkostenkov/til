1. The syntax for creating an alias is easy. You type the word "alias", 
followed by the name you want to give the alias, stick in an = sign and 
then add the command you want it to run â€“ generally enclosed in single or 
double quotes. Single word commands like "alias c=clear" don't require 
quotes.

For paths use escape chars: 
alias vscode='open -a /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app'

2. When you are satisfied with the alias - add the command to your .bashrc file

echo "alias vscode='open -a /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app'" >> ~/.bashrc
or ~/.zshrc or other file depending on your shell

3. Execute the saved alias by sourcing the file (if that's not your default config)

source ~/.bashrc
