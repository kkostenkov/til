# Never split the difference

## How to communicate with aggressive people (to avoid pitbull fight)

1. Use late night FM DJ voice. Calm, respectful, differential
2. Start phrases with "I'm sorry"
3. Mirror them
4. Use silence (at least 4 seconds after the Mirror for it to take effect on your counterpart)
5. Repeat from 1

## That's right
Getting to hear "Yes" is nothing in comparison to hearing "That's right". "That's right" means that the peer has assesed with what you've said and pronounced that this is correct with their own free will.

No not missinterpret with "You're right". The later is a loss without empassion.

## Active listening tecniques

### Effective pauses
Silence is powerful

### Minimal encouragers
Simple frases like "yes", "ok", "um-hum", "I see". To convey that talker has full attention of the listener. 

### Mirroring
(Instead of arguing) Repeat back what's said to you

### Labeling
Give each feeling your opponent you thing has and give that feeling a name.

"It all seems so tragically unfair. I can now see why you sound so angry."

Recognising and verbolising the predictable emotions of the situation.
Spot the feelings, turn them into words. Then calmly and respectfully repeat their emotions back.

A way of validating someone's emotion by acknowledging it.
Give someone's emotion a name and you show you identify how that person feels.

A shotcut to imtimacy. A time-saving emotional hack.

### Paraphrase
Repeat what you've been said in yor own words. This is supposed to show that you understand what's said to you and not just paroding your opponent concerns.

### Summarise
A good summary is the combination of rearticulating the meaning of what is said + the acknowledgement of the emotions underlyign that meaning. (paraphrasing + labeling = summary)

## Loss aversion
Convice peers that they have something to loose if deal falls through (by their inaction). Because humans will more likely to avoid losses than gain equal gains.

## Don't split the difference
Compromising is like wearing different color shoes. Meeting halfway often leads for bad deals for both sides.

## Deadline
Pressured by deadlines usualy enforces people to do things that normally is against their interests.

## F - for Fair
Drags the cionversation to the emotional side. If your opponents drops that word - ask them how exactly you are mistreating them.

## Anchor the starting point
Before you make an offer - mention how bad it would be. When you get to numbersset an extreme offer to make you real offer seem reasonable or use a range to seem less aggressive.

## Calibrated queations
Help educate your couterpart on what the problem is instead of causing conflict by telling them what the problem is.

### Direction
Paln your questions for your counterpart to think that it's them who guide you there by talking to you.

### Rules of calibrating
**NO** - Can Is Are Do Does (close ended questions)  
**SOMETIMES** - Who when where (give litte info) why (may backfire because it's accusatory)  
**THE BEST** - what how  

#### Examples
Does this look like something you would like -> How does this look to you? What about this works for you.  
Why did you do it? (accusation) -> What caused you to do it? (takes away the amotion)  
What is the biggest challenge you face?  
How would you like me to help you?  
How can I help to make this better for us?  
How would you like me to proceed?  
What is that brought us to this situation?  
Waht's the objective?  
How am I supposed to do that?  

### Implication  
You want what the other guy wants but you need his intellegence to overcome the problem.
