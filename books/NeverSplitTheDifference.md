# Never split the difference

## How to communicate with aggressive people (to avoid pitbull fight)

1. Use late night FM DJ voice. Calm, respectful, differential
2. Start phrases with "I'm sorry"
3. Mirror them
4. Use silence (at least 4 seconds after the Mirror for it to take effect on your counterpart)
5. Repeat from 1

## That's right
Getting to hear "Yes" is nothing in comparison to hearing "That's right". "That's right" means that the peer has assesed with what you've said and pronounced that this is correct with their own free will.

No not missinterpret with "You're right". The later is a loss without empassion.

## Active listening tecniques

### Effective pauses
Silence is powerful

### Minimal encouragers
Simple frases like "yes", "ok", "um-hum", "I see". To convey that talker has full attention of the listener. 

### Mirroring
(Instead of arguing) Repeat back what's said to you

### Labeling
Give each feeling your opponent you thing has and give that feeling a name.

"It all seems so tragically unfair. I can now see why you sound so angry."

Recognising and verbolising the predictable emotions of the situation.
Spot the feelings, turn them into words. Then calmly and respectfully repeat their emotions back.

A way of validating someone's emotion by acknowledging it.
Give someone's emotion a name and you show you identify how that person feels.

A shotcut to imtimacy. A time-saving emotional hack.

### Paraphrase
Repeat what you've been said in yor own words. This is supposed to show that you understand what's said to you and not just paroding your opponent concerns.

### Summarise
A good summary is the combination of rearticulating the meaning of what is said + the acknowledgement of the emotions underlyign that meaning. (paraphrasing + labeling = summary)

## Loss aversion
Convice peers that they have something to loose if deal falls through (by their inaction). Because humans will more likely to avoid losses than gain equal gains.

## Don't split the difference
Compromising is like wearing different color shoes. Meeting halfway often leads for bad deals for both sides.

## Deadline
Pressured by deadlines usualy enforces people to do things that normally is against their interests.

## F - for Fair
Drags the cionversation to the emotional side. If your opponents drops that word - ask them how exactly you are mistreating them.

## Anchor the starting point
Before you make an offer - mention how bad it would be. When you get to numbersset an extreme offer to make you real offer seem reasonable or use a range to seem less aggressive.

## Calibrated queations
Help educate your couterpart on what the problem is instead of causing conflict by telling them what the problem is.

### Direction
Paln your questions for your counterpart to think that it's them who guide you there by talking to you.

### Rules of calibrating
**NO** - Can Is Are Do Does (close ended questions)  
**SOMETIMES** - Who when where (give litte info) why (may backfire because it's accusatory)  
**THE BEST** - what how  

#### Examples
Does this look like something you would like -> How does this look to you? What about this works for you.  
Why did you do it? (accusation) -> What caused you to do it? (takes away the amotion)  
What is the biggest challenge you face?  
How would you like me to help you?  
How can I help to make this better for us?  
How would you like me to proceed?  
What is that brought us to this situation?  
Waht's the objective?  
How am I supposed to do that?  

### Implication  
You want what the other guy wants but you need his intellegence to overcome the problem.


## Listener's judo
1. Don't try to force yur opponent that you're right. Aggressive confrontation is a enemy of constructive negotiation.  
2. Avoid question that could be answered with "yes" or tiny peices of information. These require little thought and inspire people that they need a reciprocity (you would be expected to give them something back)
3. Ask calibrated questions starting with "how" or "what". 
4. Don't ask "why" questions. It's an accusation.
5. Calibrate your questions to lead the conversation to the goal that you are aiming at. 
6. Bite your tongue. When you're attacked in negotiation - make a pause and instead of fighting back ask your counterpart a calibrated question.
7. There is always a team on the other side of the table. If you are not influencing those behind the table - you are vulnerable.


## Assuring questions

Two questions to assure your counterpart that they are pushing the conversation towards their goals:
1. How will we know we're on track?
2. How will we address things if we find that we're off track?

When they answer - summarise their answer until you get a "that's right".

Two signts that might show you that they are not with you and idea is not theirs:
1. You're right
2. I'll try (which usually means "I plan to fail")
If you hear one of those - continue with calibrated "how" questions until you hear the terms of successfull implementation in their own voice. Summarise that untill you hear "that's right"

Let the other side feel victory. Let them think it was their idea. Subsume your ego. "Yes" in nothing without "how". Keep asking "how" and succeed.

## 7-38-55 rule
- 7% of a message is delivered through words
- 38% come from a tone of your voice
- 55% through the speaker's body language and face

Match tone and body language with what you tell. If you spot misalignment in others - use labels to discover what's wrong.
ex. "I heared you say Yes but there was a small hesitation in your voice."

Meet face to face.

## The rule of 3 (yes)
Getting the other guy to agree to the same thing 3 times in the same conversation.
It's very hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction.
Bury your tactics not to sound as a broken record:
- First time they agree
- Summarise the agreement and ask them if that's right
- Ask a calibrated "how" or "what" question on how are we going to guarantee success. Like "what do we do if we go off track?"

## The Pinoccio effect
Generally - lying people tend to convice that they are telling the truth more than persons telling the truth. This results in more words said.  

More "I, me, my" words use your peer - less important they are in the business.

## Use your name
Youe your real name to make yourself a real person to the other side. And even get your personal discount. Humor and humanity are the best ways to break the ice and remove roadblocks.

## 3 Types of negotiators
and tactics that would be most fitting for you.

### Analyst
- Who they are:  
Tend to minimise mistakes. Time is of little consequence. Like to get as much time as it takes to get it right.
Prefer to work on their own and rarely deviate from theig goals. They rarely show emotion and frequently use what is close to "late FM DJ voice".
Often speak in a way that is distant and cold instead of soothing. Which turns people away.  
They prepare for everything thurrowly. They expect reciprocity and if you don't give something back to them within a period  of time - they loose trust and will disengage.  
Don't expect immediate counteroffers from them.  
Silence is a time to think.

- How to deal with them:  
Vital to be prepared.
Use clear data to drive your reason. Use data comparisons to disagree and focus on facts. Avoid surprises.
Give them a chance to think. They are ok in answering labels, but tend to be slow answering calibrated questions.

- If it's you:  
Smile when you speak.

### Accomodator  
- Who they are:  
Time spend to build relationshop. As long as they are communicating - they are happy. Their goal is to be on a good term with their counterpart. Sometimes without reaching an agreement.
Have pleasent voices and are asy to talk with. Easily distracted, poor time managers.  
They want to be first to initiate the reciprocity cycle and thus sometimes may promise you something that they could not deliver.
Silence is anger to them.

- How to deal with them:  
Be soicable and friendly. Use calibrated questions to focus on the problem itself and implementation. Translate their talk into action.  
It's esasy to disagree with them because all they want is you to speak. Uncovering their objections can be difficult.

- If it's you:  
Stick your ability to be likable but do not sacrifice your objections. Not only other 2 types are willing to hearing your point of view, the other accomodator will welcome it.  
Also keep track of chit-chats.

### Assertive
- Who they are:  
Time is money. Getting the solution perfect isn't as important as getting it done. Firey people who love winning. Aggressive communication style not worried about duture communications. Their view of business communications is based on respect.  
They want to be heard and have no ability to listen to you until they know that you've heared them. They focus on their own goals and they tell rather than ask.
Silence is you have nothing to say or want them to talk.

- How to deal with them:  
Focus on what they have to say. Because understanding is the only way make them listen to you. Every silence to speak more. Mirrors are perfect tool to deal with them. So are calibrated questions, labels and summaries. "That's right" is the most important to get from them.  
Reciprocity for them is "give an inch, take a mile". They are counting seconds until you give something back to them.


- If it's you:  
Be conscuious of your tone. You either sound harsh or accepted this way. Intentially soften your tone. Use calibrated questions and labels since that will make you more approachable and increase chances of collaboration.

## The Black Swan rule
Don't treat others the way you want to be treated. Treat them the way they need to be treated. Because all people are different. And even if you divide them by those 3 groups of negotiators

## Zone of possible agreement (ZOPA)
For `|--/+++|` and `|+++/--|` ZOPA is `|--/+/--|`  
If you're dragged into the haggle you may want to say "Let's put price off to the side at the moment and talk about what would make this a good deal" (non menetary )

## Opponent is not a problem
