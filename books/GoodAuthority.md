# Good Authority

## The Five Employee Engagement Myths

1. "I can't find good people."
2. "Nobody cares as much as I do."
3. "I can't afford to invest time in someone who
is just going to leave anyway."
4. "I'm not a therapist, I don't have the skills to
help them with their personal problems."
5. "We just need better systems and more
communication."

## More Yoda less Superman
Leadership pivot that comes from pulling back the version of us
that knows how to save the day, and allowing a slower, quieter
version to come forward.

## O.W.N.E.R.
Impact-producding behaviors can be broken down into
five general buckets.
Often you'll find behaviors that are a blend, but understanding them will help you notice and start addressing them. 
acronym: OWNER.

### Own the Day

### Walk Your Talk

### Name the Challenge

### Embrace mistakes

### Risk being right

## Changing the culture
To change culture the CEO or owner has to open the door. The
only way to do that is to admit that they don't know how. It's
a moment of vulnerability.  "Hey guys, really want to make this a great place to work. And, as you know, I've tried lot of things over the years. But the truth is, even though the business has gotten better in some ways, when it comes to the culture-how people feel about coming to work here-I know it hasn't changed in the ways you need it to. I don't know how to change it but I want to start a new conversation with you about it. Okay?" Talk about strength.  

Only after the CEO admitted that he has a right to challenge employees to do the same.

## Easy to dismiss important messages
That you can use as opportunites to open up more meaningful conversation
1. _"I'd like a raise"_, the emotional story behind that might be:  
_"I don't see no one value the work I do here. It's not that I want all the credit, but I want to be acknowledged in a individual meaningful way for my
contributions and not just for my role on the team.
I've tried talking with you about this but it never really goes
anywhere. Asking for raise is my last resort."_

2. _"I'm going to work from home today"_ - they may be saying, _"This week has been hell and just need a break. It's so frustrating that we keep bumping our
against the same wall on this project."_ That doesn't mean shouldn't allow that person to have a reset. It means you should also investigate the
deeper trend that caused them to be overwhelmed in the first place.

3. _"When do you need that by?"_ what they often want to tell you is:  
_"We have way too many projects going on right now. Can you please clarify where this fits on the priorities list? And it would out the closet on all the half-finished ideas here. Alse it would be great if you could help us clean-up"_.  

4. _"Sorry, I'm late"_  
I just hear _"Sorry don't feel inspired working here. I'm not sure
what it is I wanted this job when I first got here, but I go home drained and uninspired."_

5. When something goes wrong and someone says: _"I'm not sure why that happened,"_ 
consider whether it's a _"Come on. I know, know exactly why that happened. Its because __ did ___ again. When are you guys going to hold him accountable and stop letting him drag the rest of us down?"_

## Accountability goal
The goal of accountability isn't to point out someone's weaknesses, it's to help people take full ownership of their strengths.

## Micromanagement vs accountability
Micromanagement is focused on tasks, while accountability is focused on relations.  
Micromanagement comes from a place of anxiety of mistakes, while accountability comes from a place of curiosity and desire to help people grow.

## Accountability Dial
### The Mention 
- "I saw a flurry of trouble tickets come overnight.
Anything worth talking about?"
- "You seem a bit overwhelmed this week. Something going on?"

### The Invitation
- "Remember that comment I made about typos in the newsletter the other day? I saw few in the memo to the sales team you cc'd me on just now. I'm concerned that it may be happening more often. Are you moving too fast on things?"

- "Are you still feeling overwhelmed? You seem a little harried still, but maybe it's just me. Has it gotten better? Has it gotten worse?"


### The Conversation
Two important things you can do to achieve the right balance at this place on the Dial:  
1. Stay in a supportive frame.  (Receiving critical feedback from your boss is not a easy thing.)  
2. Maintain the right balance to not try and manage the situation all your own.

Maybe find a colleague to role-play it with you first. Great managers don't manage alone.

This step includes follow-up talks and time for the employee to work on the  issue.

### The Boundary
Be ready to let person go if he does not agree on your terms.
A serious conversation that makes person know: "If you are not able to take a turn - you are not able to continue doing your job."
At this point you could be sure that you as a manager did everything you could to help this person grow.  

Proceed on the dial only of you can answer "Yes" to all of those:
1. Have you reviewed the pattern, and gotten their agreement on what it is?
2. Have you given them at least three examples so they have enough to go on to try and change things?
3. Have you emphasized the impact their behavior is having on the rest of the team?
4. Have you given them your best advice about how to work on the issue? Perhaps with a tip or tactic that's worked for you on this issue in the past?  
5. Have you kept the door open, letting them know that while this is very serious, there's still room for things to change?  
6. Have you scheduled a follow-up meeting to evaluate progress over the next few days?  
7. Have you established a clear date by which you expect to see the change start happening?

### The Limit

Should be short. It might be only 5 minutes. You shouldn't leave much space for questions or discussion. Everything that needs to be said should've been said already.  
If you find yourself feeling defensive or needing to explain, that's a good marker that you may have skipped some of the earlier steps. It might sound like: 
"I've been really pulling for you over the last month in making this change. wish it were otherwise, but I'm just not seeing it. I know you want to change, you've said the right things and I know you've tried. But something is in the way, and I don't know what that is. And I can't wait any longer. What I'd like you to do is to take the weekend and really do some soul  searching. Ask yourself if that's really a job for me? If it wasn't about losing the paycheck what would it be? Give it a weekend thing so we could finish this conversation on Monday"
The result is either giving them another chance or move forward with termination.

Share this process with your teammates. There is no reason to keep it secret.

## You are not supposed to be there
"You're the one always talking about how great the people how creative, smart, and earnest they are.  Are you saying they can't do this without you? That without your ideas in the room nothing good will happen? Doesn't that strike you as a little bit arrogant?" Ouch.

1. I made sure I had enough openings on my calendar, and wasn't jammed with back-to-back meetings, so that when people came by my office I had the time and head space to listen.
2. I insisted they each keep their weekly individual meetings with me, even if especially if they were feeling overwhelmed that week, because I've learned over the years that when we say we're overwhelmed, what's almost always behind that is something we don't know how to do that we're afraid to ask for help on.
3. I stayed in proactive communication with my peers running other departments to make sure nothing went off the rails between us or our
people, not so much to protect my people but to protect the creative space that we'd worked so hard to open up for them.
4. Most importantly, asked questions instead of giving answers. Here are some of them:
- "I'm not sure. What do you think?"
- "What would you do if I wasn't here to ask?"
- "What are you afraid will go wrong if you take
that risk?"
- "How does what you're struggling with right now relate to the long-term growth theme we've been talking about?"
- "What are you doing to take care of yourself and not get burned out?"

## Despair
"If they could do that without me, then what was my value?  
What am I being paid this big salary for if it isn't for those strengths?  
Didn't I just make myself completely replaceable and disposable?"  
I can't wait for you to have this moment. Not because I'm a sadist. But because you'll have reached the first major milestone on the road to becoming a Good Authority - you'll have fallen into the existential pit of leadership despair. Don't worry, it's not as bad as it sounds.
It's the very act of saving people, or trying to, that disempowers. It shuts them down. It invites them to play it safe and wait. It causes them to say to themselves, "I don't have to step up because he/she is going to swoop in and save the day anyway.

## Three types of leaders
By discovering your unique superhero style. and taking the risk to put the cape down, you'll be doing your part to transform your company culture.

### The Friend
The closer you are to someone personally, the higher the standard you have to hold them too, to offset the natural tendency to give them the benefit of the doubt in a way that's unfair to the others.

By being too nice, too accommodating, and too willing to look the other way, Friends will tend to create and support cultural dynamics that lack accountability and clear expectations around performance.  

People have a hard time being honest with each other because the culture mandates harmony over honesty.  

The fear which drives Friends: the fear of not being liked.  

Friends have to be willing to accept the simple, uncomfortable truth: When you have people's paychecks in your hands, you don't get to be one of the gang. That's the price of leadership.  

Tolerate the inevitable loneliness that comes with being in a leadership position.  

### The Fighter
While the Fighter has moved on to the next idea, the
next great adventure or new technology, the team is left holding the bag, This causes frustration for the team, and over the long haul undermines the inspirational and motivational qualities the Fighter otherwise brings to the table.  
Fighters rarely get to the post-game analysis.  

When Fighters learn to see these impacts and refine their approach by listening carefully to others, they to see their two or three best ideas followed through on, as opposed to seeing their six or seven ideas all remaining in half-finished form.  

The Fighter's Journey. The transformative moment for Fighters is to accept the world as it is, and learn that change happens with small steps and ongoing refinement.

The Fighter's First Step. For most Fighters the first step is to clean up the past with their team, to acknowledge the toll that their style has taken to date, and to be willing to see how overwhelmed everyone has become.  

How Can You Help a Fighter? The best gift you can give
Fighter is a strong accountability partner.  

### The Fixer
The Fixer's motto: "If you want it done right, you have to do it yourself."  
Fixers check everything personally before it goes out the door.  


They have trouble zooming out and putting themselves in the shoes of someone
who is going through something that they don't understand or haven't experienced themselves.  
When they're not vigilant, Fixers' desire for control and order blinds them to the messier, more personal, and more human elements of leading a team.

The Fixer's Journey. Fixers transform their leadership style by learning to let go of the need for too much control. Instead of learning to let go of being the one with ideas, or being the one who cheers people up, they need to let go of being the one in charge of company-wide quality control.

The Fixer's First Step. To begin their journey from Superman to Yoda, Fixers need new experiences. They'll benefit more than the other two types from time outside the office, retreats of any kind, structured or not. 

Encourage your team to use each other for a second look on things instead of coming to you; Bow out of meetings that are about process or implementation. Make yourself available for the big picture stuff. Don't fall into the trap
of thinking that you'll have time for strategic work and big picture thinking
when you're done checking off your list.


## The Five employee archetypes
many employees don't know how to relate with a boss from their own self-authority, to stand for what they feel without going over the line.  

Ask yourself questions like 
- "In which relationships am I the boss but not really acting like one?"  
- "In which relationships am I the subordinate but not acting like one?"  
- "In which relationships am I a peer but acting like either a boss or a subordinate?"

You'll learn to hold each member of your team accountable for growth in a way
that's far more about drawing them out into their strengths than harping on their weaknesses.

### The Pragmatist
Pragmatists' strength is in being able to execute on ideas and projects without unnessecary drama.
Pragmatists tend to minimise the value of their own voice.  
They tend to not push back hard enough against the ideas and initiatives of the people in the authority when they disagree with them, and let their silence build up as a resentment over time.  

The best way to help Pragmaticists is to challenge them to own this hidden strength.

To stop validating them for the things they are already great at. They don't need more praise about their timeliness, willingness to collaborate and professionalism. They need praise for the moments they break out of their shell, when they speak-up with half-formed thoughts instead of waiting to have ot all sorted.

### The Provocateur
They're the ream members who push the envelope, who are never satisfied with the current plan or direction, who are sure they have a better idea. They often do. The problem is that they don't yet have the skills to manage their ideas with-out driving their teammates crazy.

The best way you can help Provocateurs grow is to set clear boundaries. Hold them accountable for deadlines, for detailed communication, for staying on top of their commitments. 

Remember to acknowledge the small things they do along the way to improve, especially in their relationships with their teammates.

Recognizing they are part of a team of people who have gifts that complement their own will help Provocateurs feel a little bit less alone.

You'll find yourself having to be the bad guy. You're not.

### The Protector
Protectors are highly sensitive humans, deeply attuned to their
inner world and to the inner worlds of others.  
Problems start when provate life start to affect their work.  

What Protectors need, is room to feel what they feel. They need someone and it doesn't have to be their manager to let them know that it's okay to be going through a rough time at home and still come to work.  

in their family they held the emotions for other people and
smoothed the waters, but forgot about themselves too much
along the way.  

To support the growth: make it safe for them to bring more of who they are to the office.
It could be an incredible gift just by noticing that they're having a rough week.  

### The Peacemaker
He doesn't know how to say "I don't know," and he especially don't know how to say it when his boss is around.

Isn't really handling some tasks. Not because he don't want to, but because he is lacking in a skillset or a piece of background for that particular task.  

He defaulted to thinking that his value is in having the right answers instead of asking the right questions.  

As the name evokes, perhaps the Peacemaker's early relationships with authority were characterized by more violence or aggression than the other types, and that informs the working style they've developed over the years.  
Whatever the cause, they've learned to master the art of getting through a conflict without further insult or injury.  


The best way to help Peacemakers grow is to start a conversation with them about the pattern as gently as possible!

Give your Peacemaker the experience that it's okay to be frustrated or annoyed, and more importantly, that it's okay to let others know how their actions are affecting the Peacemaker. Go slow.  

Show them that healthy conflict leads to closeness and connection.

Ask them: "What are the top ten things that you don't like about working here? the things that we're not doing right for our customers? the things that we're missing opportunities on  as a leadership team?" to open them up.  

### The Performer
They excel at a particular skill and think that work that isn't in the realm of craftsmanship has less value.

Without learning to adapt, Performers run the risk of getting stuck in the way they've always done things. Under pressure, they double down on their skill instead of opening up to new experiences and knowledge.  

The best way to help Performers is to show them the personal price they're paying in keeping their distance from the team.  

Gently encourage Performers out of their solitary tendencies, and into the joys of working with others, by inviting them to participate in collaborative
projects, or perhaps to lead a team meeting.  


### Conclusion 
Do talk about them with your team. Don't keep them secret.

It's not your job to ask questions about the past or why someone learned to relate with authority way they did. It's out of bounds for leaders and managers to overshare personal history and challenges outside of work.  

Keep it about the work and everything else will take care of itself. Get as specific as you can about how you're seeing their personal struggles affecting goals and metrics. That won't make your feedback cold and impersonal. It will help to ground it with real examples that people can
relate to.  
How is their behavior making it harder for others to do their job? How is it frustrating a customer or requiring you to step in, which takes you away from the work you need to be doing? Last but not least, how are they holding themselves back by doing something that's taking them further away from their
next promotion instead of closer to it?  

We want change to happen fast. It doesn't. Not the kind of personal change we've talked about in this book. We want it to go fast. We think of change as a destination we have to get to, in order to become our better selves, when really it's an ongoing process, which we can learn to dance with, which, over time, can allow us to become our better selves. Change is not where we're going, it's who we are.  
Change isn't uncomfortable, but the prospect of changing is.  

Leadership: meeting each person where they are, pushing them to just a little bit further, and letting them know that you'll be there when they fall. Not to catch them and tell them not to feel bad. But to help them figure out why they did, to steady themselves and to give it another go. And then, when they're ready, when they take the leap and realize they had it in themselves all along, you can rest and celebrate as they do.
