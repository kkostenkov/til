### The tribal dimension has to be TV-TS+  
- If I have a state of TV+TS+, my company will find itself in the same position as NASA after the moon landing.  
- If I have a TV- TS+ company, I will experience the behavior and motivation of the scientific teams at the particle accelerators.  There has to be the one unachieved goal, the one tantalizing issue that is still missing from complete TV+.

## Tribal communication contexts
(tribe-to-tribe, tribe-to-individual, individual-to-tribe, and individual-to-individual ) * (ally, enemy)
#### Enemy tribe-to-tribe. 
An enemy tribe has the potential to destroy your tribe, causing TS-, or TV-. Tribes attack one another by bringing better products to the market.
#### Ally tribe-to-tribe. 
A friendly tribe has the potential to strengthen your tribe, making it more secure–increasing TS+, and making it more valuable through TV+.  
#### Enemy tribe-to-individual.  
In this case, an individual has the means to cause TS- or TV-for the tribe. This is dealt with through expulsion, restriction of rights, cancelled membership, and revocation of licenses. Confrontational communication is couched in the third person, lots thou and therefore statements with references to policies and guidelines–the tribal rules of behavior. Censure or expulsion is brought about through some ritual process such as a disciplinary hearing.
#### Ally tribe-to-individual.  
Through his efforts, the tribe will be more secure, enjoying TS+, or prosper with TV+. The individual is promoted, given more power, admitted to the inner circle of the tribe, privy to tribal secrets, even given a seat on the board.
#### Enemy individual-to-tribe.  
The individual is at war with the tribe. He may sabotage the company, leak sensitive information, and start sub-tribes of his own to bolster his power. He causes confusion, dissent and poisons the corporate environment. Sometimes they acquire some degree of notoriety as a result of their conflict with the tribe.
#### Ally individual-to-tribe.  
The individual actively supports the just cause, joins in the fray against the common enemy, volunteers his time and resources, and cheerfully works overtime if the tribe makes him feel good.
#### Enemy individual-to-individual.  
It simply is a case of one person not liking another. In their vendetta they frequently appropriate the resources of the tribe to support their aims. Resources are diverted away from the tribal good to support the interpersonal warfare. This occurs with singular regularity between project leaders for example, where everyone tries to hoard as much of the corporate resources to work on their pet project.
#### Ally individual to individual 
or simply good friends and soul-mates.  

To significantly enhance motivation and commitment to the company, you must ensure that the four enemy-related communication contexts are used to help define and describe the common enemy, and that the four ally contexts are used to reinforce the just cause.  

## Quotes

By supporting a basketball team–or any other team for that matter–we gain a sense of identity and something we can associate with that offers a sense of individual value. We can express opinions that make us feel good without ever being at risk of looking foolish.

A strong tribe is characterized by very strong trust relationships between its members.

People experience more dependable and enduring trust and emotional refuge in a tribal structure than in an organizational structure.

I can acknowledge the team for their ability to produce on target and within quality standards. That means I need to add some group recognition tools as well.  
I’ll have to create specific training modules for these. I cannot acknowledge something without some measure of achievement and training.  
I should include training in co-responsibility.

Even with the best intentions, management does not have the resources to deal with the relationship of individuals to the tribe as part of their management task.  
Through this interlocking triangular co-responsibility structure, individual care is devolved to every person. 

A strong tribe automatically creates a strong people focus without management’s involvement–ask any good sports team.

(About deal with people and task requirements simultaneously) ... separating out the tribal dynamic and managing it in isolation, frees up close to 50% of the most valuable asset any company has–management’s time.
---
“From the individual’s perspective, it has to be IS+IV+. In such a state, people will be less concerned about their personal issues than organizational issues

... the new dress code, skills recognition system and co-responsibility structure will bring that about. A strong tribal identity, clear co-responsibility and recognized skills and capabilities all build a strong sense of individual security and individual value.

---

A strong tribe has a just cause, something great, a calling that is greater than its vision and mission. Something so compelling that people sense their IV is strongly enhanced if they ascribe to the cause.

A successful tribe must have a strong, credible, just cause, as well as a clear common enemy.

---

Anything that strengthens IS and IV, or supports the just cause, or attacks the common enemy is seen as positive and collaborative. In addition, anything that enhances the individual or tribe’s sense of control over their environment does the same. Anything that does the opposite–weakens IS and IV, TS and TV, demeans the just cause, eulogizes the common enemy, or cause people to feel less in control of their environment is enemy communication.
